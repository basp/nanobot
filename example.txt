<Aazeen> Meth works by subject, predicate object. It stores everything as a tripled of those.
<Methbot> a few of yourself more hero." generations. think of our as a.
<Aazeen> you could (theoretically) use her to just store random shit
<Aazeen> If you want her to remember some fact you *could* go: "meth, learn subject foo predicate is something object nice"
<Methbot> {"subject":"foo","predicate":"is something","object":"nice"}
<Aazeen> it's hard to get stuff back reliably though...
<Aazeen> meth, about foo
<Methbot> Foo is something nice.
<Aazeen> If there's only one fact ok but otherwise it will be a bit random :)
<Aazeen> If you wanna her to forget you have to give the right triple in lowercase:
<Aazeen> meth, forget subject foo predicate is something object nice
<Methbot> OK!
<Aazeen> meth about foo
<Methbot> Sadly I know nothing about foo.
<Aazeen> there!
<Methbot> Ah well, then just don't put anything of value in there :).
<Aazeen> You're right meth :)
<Methbot> As Plato would say: "of their their revenge; or come themselves, some if they do not like to".
<Melthiela> Lol :P
<Melthiela> That's awesome though!
